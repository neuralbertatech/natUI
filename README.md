NeurAlbertaTech's scss framework built on top of bulma.

## Install
To add this to your project, run
```bash
# npm
npm i @neuralbertatech/
# yarn
yarn add @neuralbertatech/ui
```

## Documentation
Since this is built on top of bulma, you can refer to their [documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/) for most things. You can checkout x for the changes we've made on top.

## Development
To run the development environment and start contributing, you'll need to use a [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/). 

Once you've opened the program in a devcontainer, open a terminal and run
```bash
yarn dev
```
to start the sass watcher. This will automatically create a `css/` folder which will contain the output file `main.css`. You can use this css file as the stylesheet for testing purposes. You can find test sites in the `test/` folder.
